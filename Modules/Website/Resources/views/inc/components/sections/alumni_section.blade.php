                                <p>Its always a tough journey being the first at doing something hence the experience that I have had with
                                    Youth Lead Activity has not only changed my behavioural response to change but has shaped me into a
                                    confident citizen. Furthermore, this programme has given me an opportunity to showcase my
                                    capabilities both in the community and at my place of work. I am now regarded as a &quot;Literacy Saviour&quot;
                                    at Chibolya primary school and with everything I have been taught by the Youth Lead team, I intend not
                                    to stop here but carry on with the work.<br> My internship experience at CIDRZ has been impeccable because my expectations were exceeded by a
                                    huge margin. Not only have I been exposed to tasks in line with my qualifications, I am taken as a mere
                                    employee thus am subjected to different opportunities worthy of a civil servant.</p>

                                <p>My journey with youth lead has been amazing and challenging .Amazing in the sense that I have learnt to socialise and manage people with complex characters, project management ,accountability ,communicating and advocating for various rights for  various communities and environment. The internship has built me professionally gain experience and develop not careers such as carrying out interviews,recorder keeping ,in boarding new staff ,scheduling and setting dates for interviews and improved my writing skills .Overall thus journey has given me a stepping stone for my profession which will lead me to greater heights. Thank you Youth Lead for this great and amazing rare opportunity.
