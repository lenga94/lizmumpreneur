            <p>“I was inspired to apply for Youth Lead because it stood for what I stand for, and it gave me room to express my self-worth. With my passion to understand how NGOs operate to enhance democratic governance in Zambia, I was determined that Youth Lead would be the benchmark to that accomplishment,” Bwalya proudly stated. The skills Bwalya has acquired through Youth Lead have enhanced her abilities as a lawyer. Currently placed with FHI 360 as an Assistant Legal Intern on the USAID/Zambia-funded Open Doors project, she describes her experience with the organization as enlightening, exciting, and purpose fulfilling. Bwalya’s message to the Zambian youth is that they should never give up on their drive to becoming sources and hubs of solutions. Putting her words into action, she is currently working on a Capstone project with other youth leaders to address issues surrounding maternal mortality.</p>
